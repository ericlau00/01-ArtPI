jesseC -- 2019-11-21 23:13
	- Final design.pdf updated. New features that differ from the initial doc:
	1. Addition of another table in the database. This table relates a user to his/her saved art. We chose to use this instead of a string of a list because it is easier to work with.
	2. Added the APIs we're using (the specific names) as we have decided.
	3. Added userIDs to identify users, instead of using usernames. This is easier to search for and is just a better design choice.
	Everything else is solid. If we encounter more problems that we really can't work through with our collective knowledge, then we may have to change the design doc. I forsee this is highly unlikely, so this is probably the final version. Exceptions include typos, but I don't think there are any. At least Google Docs and my eyeballs didn't pick up any.
